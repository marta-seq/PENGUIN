Welcome to PENGUIN's documentation!
===================================

**PENGUIN** - Percentile Normalization GUI Image deNoising is a rapid and efficient image preprocessing pipeline for multiplexed spatial proteomics. In comparison to existing approaches, PENGUIN stands out by eliminating the need for manual annotation or machine learning model training. It effectively preserves signal intensity differences and reduces noise.

PENGUIN's simplicity, speed, and user-friendly interface, deployed both as script and as a Jupyter notebook, facilitate parameter testing and image processing.

This repository contains the documentation files for running PENGUIN.
